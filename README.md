# Newsify

1) Application to generate track recommendations from Spotify based that dayâ€™s news. Extract terms from news source. Use those terms to get recommended tracks from Spotify (track of the day, alternative (i.e. opposite to terms gathered), etc.)

See: https://developer.spotify.com, https://newsapi.org.

# Notice

This application has been made public including all available secret details inside the `.env` file to allow a seamless deployment experience without the examiner having to create their own private API keys and credentials. Because of this, web-crawlers search Github for private API keys and deactivate them, if this has happened it will cause the software to fail at certain-steps in the process (Newsify, Razortext, Spotify all requires these private keys.)<br/>
